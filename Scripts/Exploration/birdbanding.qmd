Here is where I am going to betray my personal ignorance of CMR analysis. The Bird Banding Survey has a record of bandings and recaptures, and the lat-long of each event. I am concerned it will be impossible to distinguish between death and dispersal in this dataset, but perhaps there is an open population CMR analysis that can do the job.
