# Goal

To break down exactly what about urbanization is biologically relevant to the house finch, and how it might affect habitat suitability and dispersal.

# Components of Land Use Change

Currently, the raster of urbanization I have been using has been based on strictly urban land area (towns and cities). I show this here.

```{r strict urban}
urb1 <- here("Data/Input/urban_raster_latlong.grd") %>% rast()
ggplot() + geom_spatraster(data = urb1, aes(fill = `AD1940`)) + 
  scale_fill_hypso_c() + ggtitle("1940")
```

However, I can expand beyond this strict definition of urbanization. I could plot out population counts instead:

```{r population count}

```
